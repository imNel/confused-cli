# Confused? Me too.
A simple script for installing software on ubuntu distros with apt and snap.
By default the script prioritizes apt over snap. 

The script can be run with ./confused.sh in the cloned folder.
Alternatively, you can copy the shell file to a folder in the path without the '.sh' extension and use confused anywhere.
